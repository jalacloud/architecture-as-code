# Architecture-as-code using declarative diagramming (D2)

This repository is my personal learning journey in the world of architecture-as-code (AAC). 

Here, I explore the power of declarative diagramming using the D2 programming language to create clear and concise diagrams that effectively communicate complex security architecture scenarios.

Within this repository, you'll find a collection of solution architecture diagrams that I've created, covering various domains and technologies. Each diagram is accompanied by detailed explanations and annotations, as I strive to not only showcase the final result but also provide insights into the architectural decisions and best practices behind them

Happy diagramming! ^_^
