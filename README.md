# Architecture-As-Code

This repository is my personal learning journey into the world of architecture-as-code (AAC). 

Here, I explore the power of using code to create solution design diagrams using the C4/Mermaid language. The goal is to create clear and concise architecture diagrams that can logically describe complex solutions.


Happy diagramming! ^_^
